Developed an Event Venue App as part of my academic coursework in Year 2, Semester 1, utilizing Java and following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Key features include:

Event Management: Simplified scheduling and booking of venues.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for seamless navigation and interaction.
Modular Codebase: Implemented MVC to ensure scalability and maintainability.
This project demonstrates my understanding of Java programming, software design principles, and architectural best practices.
